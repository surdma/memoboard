    "answer": "The Beginning of Agriculture-8000 years ago, The First Cities on the Indus-4700 years ago, A Big Kingdom in Magadha-2500 years ago, The Present -About 2000 AD/CE",
    "explanation": "The Beginning of Agriculture (8000 years ago): This marks the transition from a nomadic, hunter-gatherer lifestyle to settled farming communities. Around 8000 years ago, in various parts of the Indian subcontinent, people began cultivating crops and domesticating animals. This shift was a pivotal moment in human history, as it allowed for the growth of permanent settlements and the development of agricultural practices that would sustain communities for generations.\n\nThe First Cities on the Indus (4700 years ago): Approximately 4700 years ago, the Indus Valley Civilization emerged as one of the world's earliest urban centers. Cities such as Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa flourished along the banks of the Indus River. These ancient cities boasted advanced urban planning, sophisticated drainage systems, and a writing system that is yet to be fully deciphered. The Indus Valley Civilization represents a remarkable phase of human civilization in the Indian subcontinent.\n\nCities in the Ganga Valley, a Big Kingdom in Magadha (2500 years ago): Around 2500 years ago, the Ganga Valley became a focal point for the rise of early states and kingdoms in the Indian subcontinent. One of the most notable developments during this period was the emergence of the Magadha kingdom. It played a crucial role in shaping the political landscape of ancient India and eventually gave rise to major empires like the Maurya and Gupta dynasties. This period also saw the spread of religions like Buddhism and Jainism.\n\nThe Present (About 2000 AD/CE): Referring to the present day, around 2000 AD/CE, this marks the contemporary era in Indian history. By this time, India had gone through a series of empires, invasions, and colonial rule. It eventually gained independence from British colonial rule in 1947 and became the modern nation-state of India. The present era encompasses India's rich cultural diversity, economic growth, technological advancements, and its role as one of the world's largest democracies.(Reference: NCERT History Class 6(Ch 1)",

Bodhisattvas are revered figures in Mahayana Buddhism, and they are believed to embody compassion and selflessness.\n\n Some well-known Bodhisattvas include Avalokiteshvara (the Bodhisattva of Compassion) and Manjushri (the Bodhisattva of Wisdom)..(Reference: NCERT History Class 6 (ch 6)",

    "answer": "only 2",
    "explanation": "Statement (2) is correct. Bodhisattvas in Buddhism are enlightened beings who, out of compassion, choose to remain in the world to teach and assist others on their path to enlightenment. \n\nThey are considered altruistic spiritual guides who postpone their own entry into Nirvana (enlightenment) to help all sentient beings attain liberation from suffering. This selfless act of compassion is a central concept in Mahayana Buddhism, where Bodhisattvas play a significant role in inspiring and guiding practitioners on their spiritual journeys. \n\nThey are revered figures who embody the ideals of compassion and selflessness, often depicted in various forms in Buddhist art and iconography..(Reference: NCERT History Class 6 (ch 6)",

    "explanation": "Ashoka did send his son, Mahendra, and daughter, Sanghamitra, on a mission to propagate Buddhist teachings and the principles of dhamma. However, their mission was not to Greece but to other parts of the Indian subcontinent, particularly Sri Lanka. Mahendra and Sanghamitra are credited with playing a significant role in spreading Buddhism in Sri Lanka and other nearby regions.\n\nThe reason provided, which states that Ashoka wanted to promote his message in distant lands, is accurate. Ashoka was indeed committed to spreading his message of dhamma and the principles of Buddhism, not only within his empire but also to neighboring regions. While he didn't send his children to Greece, he did send them to areas where his message could have a significant impact..(Reference: NCERT History Class 6 (ch 7)",

    "explanation": "the Pallava kingdom in ancient India had territorial control and influence that stretched from the area near their capital city, Kanchipuram, to the Kaveri delta.

Indian mathematicians recognized the importance of zero as a placeholder in numerical systems, and they introduced the concept and symbol for zero long before it was adopted in Europe. The reason, on the other hand, is true to some extent, as European mathematicians did adopt and adapt the Indian numeral system, including the use of zero, after it was introduced to them.

In fact, Aryabhata faced criticism and opposition for some of his astronomical theories. It was only in later centuries that his work gained recognition and influence. The reason provided, which suggests that his discoveries were praised and acknowledged during his time, is also false.

    "answer": "2 and 3",
    "explanation": "The Cheras introduced the Malayalam language and script in their inscriptions.\nExplanation: This statement is incorrect. While the Cheras were an ancient dynasty in South India, the development of the Malayalam language and script was a gradual process that evolved over centuries in the region now known as Kerala. The Cheras may have contributed to the region's cultural and historical development, but they did not introduce the Malayalam language and script as a whole.\n\nThe temple theatre of Kerala borrowed stories from the Sanskrit epics.\nExplanation: This statement is correct. The temple theatre of Kerala, particularly the traditional art forms like Kathakali and Koodiyattam, did draw upon stories and themes from Sanskrit epics such as the Ramayana and Mahabharata. These classical art forms used mythological narratives as a basis for their performances, adapting and interpreting them within the Kerala cultural context. Sanskrit epics played a significant role in shaping the content and themes of Kerala's temple theatre.\n\nThe Cholas ruled over Kerala.\nExplanation: This statement is partially correct. The Cholas were a prominent dynasty in South India and had periods of influence in Kerala, but they did not have continuous or long-term control over the region. Kerala's history includes periods of rule by various dynasties, including the Cheras, Cholas, and later dynasties like the Zamorins of Calicut and the Travancore royal family.

The cult of Jagannatha was introduced in the twelfth century by the Mughals. \n\n3. The authority of the Jagannatha temple in Puri increased as a center of pilgrimage.",
    "answer": "1 and 2",
    "explanation": "The Jagannatha cult at Puri originated from a local tribal deity.\nThis statement is not entirely correct. The origin of the Jagannatha cult at Puri is traditionally associated with Lord Jagannatha, a deity worshipped as a form of Lord Vishnu. While the cult may have evolved over time and incorporated elements from local traditions, it is primarily centered around Lord Jagannatha, not a tribal deity.\n\nThe cult of Jagannatha was introduced in the twelfth century by the Mughals.\nThis statement is incorrect. The cult of Jagannatha in Puri has much older origins and was well-established long before the twelfth century. It is believed to have ancient roots and was an integral part of the cultural and religious heritage of the region. The Mughals, who arrived in India during the medieval period, did not introduce the cult but respected the religious diversity of the land.\n\nThe authority of the Jagannatha temple in Puri increased as a center of pilgrimage.\nThis statement is correct. Over time, the Jagannatha temple in Puri has grown in prominence as a major center of pilgrimage and religious devotion. It has attracted devotees from various parts of India and beyond, contributing to its status as one of the Char Dham pilgrimage sites for Hindus. The temple's authority and significance have increased as it became a revered place of worship and a symbol of Odisha's cultural heritage.(Reference NCERT History Class 7 (Ch 9))",

    "answer": "3 only",
    "explanation": "Rajputs cherished the ideal of the heroic warrior who fought valiantly.\nExplanation: This statement is correct. Rajputs, the warrior clans of medieval India, indeed cherished the ideal of the heroic warrior who demonstrated bravery and valor on the battlefield. The Rajput ethos emphasized qualities such as courage, honor, and chivalry in warfare.\n\nRajput heroes' stories were recorded in poems and songs.\nExplanation: This statement is correct. Rajput heroes and their deeds were often celebrated and immortalized in the form of poems, songs, and ballads. These narratives, known as \"ballads\" or \"bards' songs,\" were passed down through oral traditions and later recorded in written form. They recounted the heroic exploits and tales of valor of Rajput warriors.\n\nRajputs were initially known for their trade.\nExplanation: This statement is incorrect. Rajputs were primarily known for their martial traditions and warrior ethos. They were renowned for their military prowess, feudal structure, and role as protectors of the land. While trade and other economic activities did exist within the Rajput kingdoms, their core identity and fame were tied to their warrior heritage rather than trade.(Reference NCERT History Class 7 (Ch 9))",

    "answer": "only two",
    "explanation": "Kathak evolved into a distinct mode of dance with the spread of the bhakti movement.\nExplanation: This statement is incorrect.
