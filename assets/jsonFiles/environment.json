    "answer": "Only two",
    "explanation": "A food web represents a simplified, isolated relationship within an ecosystem\nIncorrect A food web represents a complex network of interconnected food chains within an ecosystem, not a simplified or isolated relationship It shows how different species in an ecosystem interact with each other through feeding relationships\n\nPyramid of biomass always has an upright shape in terrestrial ecosystems\nIncorrect The pyramid of biomass represents the total biomass (the weight of living organisms) at each trophic level in an ecosystem In some terrestrial ecosystems, the pyramid of biomass can have an inverted shape, especially when there are large numbers of small organisms at higher trophic levels and fewer large producers at the base of the food chain This is common in ecosystems like forests, where a large number of herbivores may be supported by a relatively small number of large trees\n\nBiological magnification is the phenomenon where toxic substances decrease in concentration progressively at higher levels of the food chain\nCorrect Biological magnification (also known as biomagnification or bioaccumulation) is the process by which certain toxic substances, such as persistent organic pollutants or heavy metals, increase in concentration as they move up the food chain This is because these substances are not easily metabolized or excreted by organisms, so they accumulate in the tissues of organisms at higher trophic levels",

    "explanation": "Grasslands are mainly found in regions with less than 25 cm of rainfall - This statement is incorrect Grasslands are typically found in regions with more rainfall than 25 cm but less than what is required to support forests They are often characterized by a semi-arid to subhumid climate\n\nSteppe formations have a longer wet season compared to savannas - This statement is incorrect Steppe formations and savannas can vary in terms of their climate patterns, but generally, savannas tend to have a longer wet season compared to steppes Savannas have a tropical or subtropical climate with distinct wet and dry seasons\n\nThe primary economic importance of grasslands is for timber production - This statement is incorrect The primary economic importance of grasslands often lies in agriculture, including livestock grazing and crop cultivation Grasslands are not typically associated with timber production, as they lack the dense forests necessary for timber harvesting\n\nGrazing pressure can lead to a deterioration in the quality of grasslands - This statement is correct Excessive grazing pressure can degrade grasslands by reducing plant cover and biodiversity, leading to soil erosion and a decline in the quality of forage for livestock",

This process involves assessing the risks of accidents, such as fires, explosions, hazardous releases, and dam breaks, that may result from the project's activities. By identifying these scenarios, stakeholders can develop strategies to prevent or mitigate these risks, ensuring the safety of the environment, nearby communities, and project personnel. Risk Assessment is a crucial step in responsible project planning and management.",

    "explanation": "Public Hearings play a vital role in the environmental clearance process. Their purpose is to engage the public in the decision-making process related to a proposed project. During Public Hearings, individuals and environmental groups are invited to express their views, suggestions, comments, and objections regarding the project's potential environmental impacts. This input ensures transparency and public participation in the decision-making process, allowing regulatory authorities to consider community concerns and opinions before granting or denying environmental clearance for the project.",

Endangered (EN) criteria: reduction in population size (70% over the last 10 years)\n\n3. Vulnerable (VU) criteria: reduction in population (> 50% over the last 10 years)",
    "answer": "All of the above.",
    "explanation": "The criteria for different levels of endangerment (Critically Endangered, Endangered, and Vulnerable) are based on reductions in population size over the last 10 years. For Critically Endangered, the reduction must be greater than 90%, for Endangered, it must be 70%, and for Vulnerable, it must be greater than 50%.",
