R. Ambedkar to prepare a Draft Constitution of India.\n\n3.On 26th November 1949, the Constituent Assembly adopted the final draft of the Constitution, which then came into effect on 26th January 1950, celebrated as Republic Day.\n\n4.The Constitution Day was celebrated for the first time in 1950 immediately after the adoption of the Constitution.",
    "answer": "1 and 3 Only",
    "explanation": "Statement 1 is Correct, The Constitution Day, also known as Samvidhan Divas, is observed on 26th November. It was introduced in 2015 by the Government of India to commemorate the adoption of the Constitution and to honor the memory of Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, who played a seminal role in its drafting\n\nStatement 2 is factually incorrect. The Drafting Committee was set up by the Constituent Assembly on 29th August 1947 with Dr. B. R. Ambedkar as its chairman. The purpose of this committee was to draft the Constitution. By 26th November 1949, this draft was finalized and adopted by the Constituent Assembly.\n\nStatement 3 is Correct elaborates on the significance of 26th November. After rigorous debates and discussions, the Constituent Assembly finalized and adopted the Constitution on this day. However, it was decided to wait until 26th January 1950 for the Constitution to come into effect, marking India's transformation into a republic.\n\nStatement 4 is Incorrect. While the Constitution was adopted in 1949 and came into effect in 1950, the celebration of Constitution Day as an annual event began only in 2015. The Government of India declared 26th November as Constitution Day in that year to commemorate the 125th birth anniversary of Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, recognizing his pivotal role in the formation of the Constitution.",

    "explanation": "In the landmark Kesavananda Bharati case (1973), the Supreme Court of India ruled that while the Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, there is a \"basic structure\" of the Constitution that cannot be altered or destroyed through amendments. The court held that a Constitutional amendment can be challenged if it violates or seeks to alter this \"basic structure.\"\n\nThe \"basic structure\" doctrine, as established in this case, means that certain fundamental features of the Constitution, which include democracy, the rule of law, secularism, federalism, separation of powers, and the protection of Fundamental Rights, are beyond the amending power of the Parliament.
