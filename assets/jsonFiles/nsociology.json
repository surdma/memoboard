    "explanation": "Class 11 Sociology - Study of Human Social Life:\nClass 11 Sociology is the systematic study of human society, social structures, and interactions. It examines patterns, institutions, and behaviors, providing insights into the complexities of social life, helping understand societal issues, and contributing to the formulation of social theories and solutions.\n\nEmpirical - Based on Observations and Findings:\nEmpirical refers to knowledge derived from observable phenomena and factual evidence. In Class 11 Sociology, empirical research involves collecting and analyzing data through systematic observation or experimentation, ensuring that theories and conclusions are grounded in real-world observations and experiences.\n\nPhilosophy - Reflections on Moral Values:\nPhilosophy involves critical reflection on fundamental questions, including ethics and moral values. In Class 11 Sociology, philosophical perspectives contribute to the understanding of societal norms, moral dilemmas, and ethical considerations, shaping discussions on justice, equality, and the moral fabric of societies.\n\nNorms - Concerned with Norms and Values:\nNorms are societal rules or expectations defining appropriate behavior. In Class 11 Sociology, the study of norms delves into the shared values and expectations that guide human conduct. Examining norms helps understand societal standards, cultural practices, and the moral framework influencing individual and collective behavior.(Reference NCERT Class 11 Sociology Class 11(Ch 1)",

    "explanation": "Dehumanizing Effect - 18th and 19th Centuries:\nThe 18th and 19th centuries witnessed industrialization, which, while advancing technology, often had a dehumanizing impact on workers. Harsh working conditions, long hours, and exploitation in factories reflected a darker side of progress, challenging the humane aspects of societal development during this period.\n\nTempo of Labour - Synchronization of Labour by Clock:\nThe synchronization of labor by the clock became a defining feature of industrialization. Workers' activities were regimented to fit specific timeframes, dictated by clock hours. This imposed structure transformed the tempo of labor, emphasizing efficiency but also contributing to the mechanization and dehumanization of work.\n\nClock and Calendar - Set by Factors like Daylight and Social Duties:\nThe measurement of time by the clock and calendar became crucial during industrialization. However, in earlier times, these temporal markers were influenced by natural factors like daylight and societal duties. The advent of industrialization brought about a shift in timekeeping, emphasizing precision and standardized work hours.\n\nUrban Centres - Basis of Social Organization:\nUrban centers, shaped by industrialization, became the focal points of social organization in the 18th and 19th centuries. The migration from rural areas to cities for employment led to the concentration of people, industries, and resources. Urbanization altered societal structures, introducing new challenges and opportunities in the evolving social landscape.(Reference NCERT Class 11 Sociology Class 11(Ch 1)",

This approach sought empirical evidence and systematic analysis to understand and address societal issues, bridging the gap between the scientific method and the complexities of human affairs.\n\nSocial Survey - Human Phenomena Can Be Classified and Measured:\nSocial surveys involved the systematic classification and measurement of human phenomena. Through structured inquiries, researchers aimed to gather quantifiable data, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of social patterns and behaviors, contributing to a scientific understanding of society.\n\nEnlightenment - Knowledge Promised Solution to Social Ills:\nThe Enlightenment era emphasized reason, science, and knowledge as agents of positive social change. Enlightenment thinkers believed that acquiring knowledge and applying reason could lead to solutions for prevalent social problems, fostering progress, and societal betterment.\n\nPoverty - Economic Regimentation:\nPoverty, in the context of economic regimentation, signifies the systematic control and regulation of economic aspects.

    "explanation": "Human Societies - Different Types Categorized and Distinguished:\nThe study of human societies involves categorizing and distinguishing between various types based on social structures, norms, and cultural attributes. Sociologists analyze the diversity of societies to understand patterns of interaction, governance, and cultural practices, contributing to a nuanced comprehension of human social life.\n\nFactory Production - Systems of Parts with Given Functions:\nFactory production entails organizing systems where individual parts have specific functions within a larger process. This assembly-line approach, pioneered during the Industrial Revolution, involves the division of labor, specialization, and coordination of tasks, leading to increased efficiency and mass production in manufacturing.\n\nClock-Time - Influence of Clock and Calendar:\nThe concept of clock time is shaped by the influence of standardized timekeeping devices like clocks and calendars. This temporal organization affects societal rhythms, work schedules, and social interactions. The adoption of clock time has profound implications for coordinating activities and synchronizing collective endeavors in human societies.\n\nEvolutionary Vision - Influence of Natural Evolution:\nAn evolutionary vision involves understanding societal development through the lens of natural evolution. Societal changes are viewed as analogous to biological evolution, with societies adapting and evolving over time. This perspective provides a framework for analyzing the progression and transformation of human societies in a dynamic and adaptive manner.(Reference NCERT Class 11 Sociology Class 11(Ch 1)",

Shah argues that the increase in joint families is due to decreasing life expectancy.\n\n4) The unintended consequences of German unification led to an increase in marriage.\n\nWhich of the above statements are correct?",
    "answer": "1 and 2",
    "explanation": "Statement 1 is correct. The functionalist perspective indeed suggests that the nuclear family is well-suited to handling the demands of industrial society.\n\nStatement 2 is correct. The joint family system has, in fact, decreased in post-independent India, with a trend towards nuclear and smaller families.\n\nStatement 3 is incorrect. A.M.

This view suggests that such structures align with the division of labor and economic roles in industrialized settings.\n\nFemale-headed households - Challenged existence from a sociological perspective: Sociological perspectives recognize that female-headed households can face unique challenges, including economic disparities and societal biases.

Instead, it emphasizes the power dynamics, inequalities, and challenges faced by individuals within family structures, offering a more nuanced perspective.\n\nEnforced cooperation: Strategy developed to cope with conflict in households: Enforced cooperation refers to a strategy employed within households to manage conflicts. It involves imposing a cooperative faÃ§ade, even in situations where genuine agreement or collaboration may be lacking, as a means of maintaining stability.\n\nCovert conflict: Possibility discussed by Amartya Sen in cooperation: Amartya Sen's discussion of covert conflict within cooperation suggests that underlying tensions and conflicts may exist beneath the surface of apparent collaboration.

    "explanation": "Mechanical solidarity: Form of social cohesion based on sameness: Mechanical solidarity, as conceptualized by Emile Durkheim, refers to social cohesion in traditional societies where individuals share similar beliefs, values, and experiences. The solidarity is based on the similarity of members rather than their differences.\n\nOrganic solidarity: Form of social cohesion based on division of labour: Organic solidarity, also proposed by Durkheim, describes social cohesion in modern, complex societies. Here, interdependence arises from the specialization of individuals in different roles and occupations, forming a collective reliance on each other's contributions.\n\nDivision of labour: Karl Marx's perspective on cooperation: Karl Marx viewed the division of labour not merely as a cooperative arrangement but as a source of potential conflict in capitalist societies. He emphasized how it could lead to alienation, where workers lose control over their work and the products of their labour.\n\nAlienation: Loss of control over the products of one's labour: Marx's concept of alienation pertains to the estrangement of workers from the products of their labour and the process itself. It involves a loss of control, autonomy, and fulfillment in the work, reflecting the dehumanizing aspects of certain modes of production.(Reference NCERT Sociology Class 11 part 2(CH 1))",

    "explanation": "Karl Marx: Associated with a conflict perspective: Karl Marx, a key figure in sociology, is often linked to the conflict perspective. His work emphasizes social conflict arising from class struggles, particularly in capitalist societies, where he highlighted the exploitation of the working class by the bourgeoisie.\n\nEmile Durkheim: Usually identified with a functionalist perspective: Emile Durkheim is commonly associated with the functionalist perspective. His focus was on the role of social structures in maintaining stability and order in society. Durkheim explored how institutions contribute to the functioning and cohesion of social systems.\n\nCooperation, and conflict: Understand processes differently based on perspectives: Different sociological perspectives, such as functionalism and conflict theory, offer distinct views on cooperation, competition, and conflict. While functionalism sees them as universal features necessary for societal functioning, conflict theory emphasizes how power imbalances contribute to social conflicts.\n\nFunctionalism and conflict perspective: Universal features explained by inevitable interactions in society: Both functionalism and the conflict perspective recognize cooperation, competition, and conflict as integral to human societies. However, they interpret these dynamics differently. Functionalism views them as essential for maintaining societal order, while the conflict perspective sees them as products of power struggles and inequality.(Reference NCERT Sociology Class 11 part 2(CH 1))",

He highlighted that social cooperation is enforced and not the result of individuals willingly coming together but is shaped by the existing class relations.\n\nCompetition: Often viewed as a universal and natural concept: Competition is frequently perceived as a universal and natural aspect of human interaction. This perspective suggests that competition is inherent in human nature and is observed across various social, economic, and cultural contexts.\n\nEnforced cooperation: Form of social entity that emerges and becomes dominant at a historical point: Enforced cooperation is seen as a social entity that emerges and becomes dominant at specific historical junctures. This concept implies that certain forms of cooperation are not voluntary but arise due to historical conditions, power dynamics, or societal changes.\n\nFunctionalism: Viewed as an effort to compromise and co-exist despite conflict: From a functionalist perspective, cooperation is often explained as a form of accommodation.
