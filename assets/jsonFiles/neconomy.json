So, the total income of all four families is:\n\nTotal income = Average per capita income * Number of families\nTotal income = Rs 5000 * 4 = Rs 20,000\n\nNow, we know the total income of the three families is Rs 4000 + Rs 7000 + Rs 3000 = Rs 14,000.\n\nTo find the income of the fourth family, subtract the total income of the three families from the total income:\n\nIncome of fourth family = Total income - Total income of three families\nIncome of fourth family = Rs 20,000 - Rs 14,000 = Rs 6,000\n\nSo, the income of the fourth family is Rs 6000.

The Net Attendance Ratio (NAR) is indeed calculated as the total number of children of a specific age group (e.g., 6-10) attending school as a percentage of the total number of children in the same age group.\n\nPer capita income: Measure of material goods and services - This is not a correct match. Per capita income is a measure of the average income of individuals in a country or region.

Reducing pollution typically requires collective efforts, regulations, and environmental conservation measures.\n\nCollective provision: Cheaper for goods and services - This is a correct match. Collective provision of goods and services, often through government or public programs, can sometimes lead to cost savings due to economies of scale and the ability to distribute resources more efficiently to the population.\n\nIncome by itself: Adequate indicator of material goods and services - This is not a correct match. Income by itself is not always an adequate indicator of material goods and services. It provides information about an individual's or household's financial resources but does not account for factors such as access, distribution, and the availability of goods and services.\n\nPublic Distribution System (PDS): Functions well in all states - This is not a correct match.

The Human Development Report (UNDP) does not primarily compare countries based on per capita income. It assesses human development using the Human Development Index (HDI), which includes indicators related to health, education, and per capita income. So, this statement is inaccurate.\n\nDevelopment criterion: Should include health, education, and per capita income - This is a correct match. Development criteria often include indicators related to health, education, and per capita income. These are commonly used to assess the overall well-being and development of a country's population.\n\nIndia's rank in HDI: Higher than Sri Lanka - This is not a correct match. The Human Development Index (HDI) ranks countries based on their level of human development, considering various factors like health, education, and per capita income.

Renewable resources are indeed replenished by natural processes over time, such as groundwater being recharged through rainfall and natural filtration.\n\nOverusing groundwater: Reduces its availability - This is a correct match. Overusing groundwater by extracting it at a faster rate than it can be naturally replenished can lead to a reduction in its availability. This is a common issue with groundwater depletion.\n\nNon-renewable resources: Get exhausted after years of use, e.g., crude oil - This is a correct match. Non-renewable resources are finite and can get exhausted over time as they are extracted and used. Crude oil is an example of a non-renewable resource.\n\nNew sources: Increase the stock of non-renewable resources - This is not a correct match. Non-renewable resources cannot be increased or replenished naturally. They are finite, and their stock diminishes as they are extracted and used.

    "explanation": "Infant Mortality Rate: The Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) is a vital health indicator that quantifies the number of children who die before reaching the age of one per 1,000 live births. It reflects a nation's healthcare quality, access to medical services, and overall child well-being.\n\nLiteracy Rate: The Literacy Rate signifies the proportion of the population aged 7 and above who can read and write. It serves as a crucial educational indicator, reflecting a nation's success in providing basic literacy skills and fostering access to knowledge and information.\n\nNet Attendance Ratio: The Net Attendance Ratio (NAR) is the percentage of children between the ages of 10 and 14 who attend school regularly. It assesses school attendance within a specific age group and provides insights into educational access and retention rates, impacting a country's human capital development.\n\nPer Capita Income: Per Capita Income represents the average income earned by each individual in a specific region or country. Calculated by dividing the total income by the total population, it offers a key economic indicator that measures the standard of living and overall economic well-being within a given area.

This indicates that relatively few infants die before their first birthday, reflecting robust healthcare systems, high-quality medical care, and a focus on maternal and child health in the state.\n\nPunjab - High Per Capita Income: Punjab, located in northern India, is characterized by a high Per Capita Income. The state's residents enjoy a relatively higher average income per person, which signifies economic prosperity, agricultural productivity, and industrial development.\n\nBihar - Low Literacy Rate: Bihar, a state in eastern India, faces challenges related to education, resulting in a low Literacy Rate. A significant portion of its population lacks basic literacy skills, highlighting the need for improved access to education, better infrastructure, and educational reforms.\n\nUttar Pradesh - Low Literacy Rate for Females: Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, reports a low Literacy Rate among females. This underscores gender disparities in education, indicating that a substantial proportion of women and girls in the state face limited access to quality education and literacy opportunities. Efforts are needed to address this gender gap. (Reference NCERT Economy Class 10 (Ch 1))",

    "explanation": "Human Development Index (HDI): The Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite measure used to compare countries based on key dimensions of human well-being, including education (measured by literacy and school enrollment), health (measured by life expectancy), and income (measured by per capita income). HDI provides a comprehensive assessment of a country's development status.\n\nSustainable Development: Sustainable Development refers to a development approach that aims to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It emphasizes economic, social, and environmental aspects to ensure that development is both enduring and responsible.\n\nGroundwater Overuse: Groundwater Overuse occurs when the extraction of groundwater from underground aquifers exceeds the natural recharge rate, depleting the resource faster than it can be naturally replenished. This overuse poses a significant threat to water resources, leading to the depletion of vital water reserves and potential environmental consequences.\n\nNon-renewable Resources: Non-renewable Resources are finite natural resources that cannot be replaced on a human timescale once they are depleted. They include minerals, fossil fuels (like crude oil and coal), and other resources that are exhaustible over time. Effective resource management is crucial to ensure their sustainable use.\n (Reference NCERT Economy Class 10 (Ch 1))",

    "answer": "BMI Calculation-Divide weight by the square of height, Undernourished-BMI less than 18.5, Overweight-BMI more than 25, Sustainable Development-Maintaining development for future generations",
    "explanation": "BMI Calculation: BMI (Body Mass Index) is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. It is commonly used as an indicator of a person's body weight relative to their height and is often employed in assessing whether an individual is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.\n\nUndernourished: Individuals are considered undernourished when their BMI is less than 18.5. This suggests that they have insufficient body weight relative to their height, which can be an indicator of malnutrition and potential health issues.\n\nOverweight: Overweight individuals have a BMI that is more than 25. Being overweight indicates that a person has excess body weight relative to their height, which can be associated with health risks such as cardiovascular problems and obesity-related diseases.\n\nSustainable Development: Sustainable Development refers to the practice of meeting present needs while ensuring that future generations can meet their own needs. It encompasses economic, social, and environmental dimensions to ensure that development is not only long-lasting but also considers the well-being of the planet and future generations.\n (Reference NCERT Economy Class 10 (Ch 1))",

It is the largest employer in India, providing livelihoods to millions of people, particularly in rural areas. Despite its significance, the agriculture sector faces challenges such as low productivity and income disparities.\n\nTertiary Sector: Also known as the service sector, it includes various service-based industries like healthcare, education, finance, and IT. The tertiary sector has the highest contribution to India's GDP, reflecting the nation's increasing focus on services and the growth of urban areas.\n\nUnderemployment: Underemployment occurs when individuals are not fully utilized in their jobs, resulting in their skills and potential being underutilized. In India, this is often observed in the agriculture sector, where multiple family members work on small farms, even though fewer workers could accomplish the same tasks.\n\nDisguised Unemployment: Disguised unemployment refers to a situation in the primary sector (agriculture) where there are more workers engaged in a task than required. Removing a few workers would not affect production. It is called \"disguised\" because these surplus workers appear employed but contribute minimally to output, making it less obvious than unemployment. (Reference NCERT Economy Class 10 (Ch 2))",

It serves as a key indicator of a nation's economic health and measures the overall economic activity and productivity of a country.\n\nOutsourcing: Outsourcing refers to the practice of contracting or subcontracting certain business functions or tasks to external companies or service providers. This is often done to reduce costs, access specialized skills, or focus on core business activities.\n\nDisguised Unemployment: Disguised unemployment occurs when individuals appear to be employed but are actually underutilized in their roles. It usually arises in sectors where more people are engaged in a task than necessary, resulting in low productivity per worker.\n\nInformal Economy: The informal economy encompasses economic activities that operate outside of government regulation and oversight. It often includes unregistered businesses, casual labor, and unreported income.

It provides a legal guarantee of 100 days of wage employment per year to rural households, thereby addressing unemployment and poverty issues in rural areas.\n\nOrganised Sector: The organised sector refers to that part of the economy where businesses and enterprises follow government regulations and formal employment practices. These businesses are typically registered, pay taxes, provide benefits like regular salaries, job security, and adhere to labor laws, ensuring a more structured and predictable work environment.\n\nUnorganised Sector: The unorganised sector comprises economic activities and labor that operate outside the purview of formal regulations.

They are often dependent on daily wage labor in agriculture and face job insecurity and uncertain income. Their work is typically seasonal and lacks the benefits associated with formal employment.\n\nSmall-Scale Industry: Small-scale industries can belong to the organised sector where they follow government regulations and labor laws. However, some may also operate informally in the unorganised sector. These industries are characterized by their relatively small size and often focus on manufacturing or production on a smaller scale compared to large corporations.\n\nScheduled Castes and Tribes: These are vulnerable workers in the unorganised sector, often belonging to historically marginalized communities. They face social discrimination and economic challenges. Government policies aim to provide them with opportunities and protection, recognizing the need for affirmative action to address historical inequalities.\n\nOvertime Payment: Overtime payment is the compensation provided to workers for the extra hours they work beyond their regular working hours. It is typically higher than the regular wage rate and serves as an incentive for employees to work additional hours. This practice is common in both the organised and unorganised sectors to reward employees for their extra efforts.\n\n\n (Reference NCERT Economy Class 10 (Ch 2))",

Currency: Made of precious metals\n4. Modern Banking: Eliminates the need for money\n\nSelect the correct answer using the codes given below: Codes:",
    "answer": "1 and 2",
    "explanation": "Barter System: Exchange of goods for goods - This pair is correctly matched. In a barter system, goods are exchanged directly for other goods without the use of money as an intermediary. Individuals trade what they have for what they need.\n\nDouble Coincidence of Wants: Not required in a money-based economy - This pair is also correctly matched. In a money-based economy, the double coincidence of wants is not required because money serves as a universally accepted medium of exchange. People can use money to buy and sell goods and services without needing to find someone with precisely complementary wants.\n\nCurrency: Made of precious metals - This pair is not correctly matched. Currency today is typically not made of precious metals like gold or silver. Most modern currencies are fiat currencies, meaning their value is not tied to a physical commodity but is established by government decree and is based on the trust and confidence of the people using it.\n\nModern Banking: Eliminates the need for money - This pair is not correctly matched. Modern banking does not eliminate the need for money. Instead, it provides a system for the efficient management, storage, lending, and transfer of money. Money remains an essential component of the modern banking system. (Reference NCERT Economy Class 10 (Ch 3))",

    "explanation": "Modern currency: Made of precious metals - This pair is not correctly matched. Modern currency is typically not made of precious metals. Most modern currencies are fiat currencies, which means their value is not backed by physical commodities like gold or silver but is based on trust in the issuing government and its ability to maintain the currency's value.\n\nBanks: Issue currency notes - This pair is correct. Banks do play a role in the issuance and management of currency notes, but they are not the sole entities responsible for this. In many countries, central banks, like the Reserve Bank of India, are the ones authorized to issue and regulate currency notes.\n\nLoans by banks: Main source of income for depositors - This pair is not correctly matched. Loans by banks are a source of income for the banks themselves, not for depositors. Banks generate income from the interest they charge on loans, which contributes to their profitability.\n\nCredit in a debt-trap situation: Helps improve earnings - This pair is not correct. In a debt-trap situation, individuals or entities are often burdened with high levels of debt, and additional credit can exacerbate their financial difficulties rather than improving earnings. It's crucial to manage debt wisely to avoid falling into a debt trap. (Reference NCERT Economy Class 10 (Ch 3))",

    "explanation": "Metallic Coins Made of Precious Metals: Metallic coins, historically, were crafted from precious metals like gold and silver. Their intrinsic value often matched their face value, making them valuable for transactions and stores of wealth. However, in modern economies, coins are typically made from less valuable metals or alloys.\n\nCurrency Authorized by the Government: Currency, in the form of paper notes and digital money, is authorized and regulated by the government or central authority. It's the official medium of exchange, representing the value of goods and services, and is backed by the government's trust and stability.\n\nDeposits with Banks Widely Accepted as a Means of Payment: Deposits held in banks, such as savings and checking accounts, are widely accepted as a means of payment. Through checks, debit cards, and electronic transfers, people can easily access and transfer their deposited funds to settle transactions, making them a crucial part of the modern payment system.\n\nDemand Deposits Can Be Withdrawn on Demand: Demand deposits, like checking accounts, are funds held in banks that account holders can withdraw at any time without prior notice.

    "explanation": "Credit - Money Supplied by the Lender: Credit refers to the financial arrangement where a lender provides funds to a borrower with the expectation of repayment, often with interest. It is essentially borrowed money that allows individuals or businesses to make purchases or investments they might not afford otherwise.\n\nDeposit - Money Stored in a Bank Account: A deposit involves placing money, whether in the form of cash or electronic funds, into a bank account. These funds are securely stored with the bank and can be withdrawn or accessed as needed by the account holder while earning interest or other benefits.\n\nCurrency - Paper Notes and Coins: Currency represents the physical form of money in an economy, typically in the form of paper notes and metal coins. It is widely accepted as a medium of exchange and a store of value, allowing individuals to conduct everyday transactions.\n\nDemand Deposits - Agreement to Pay Money Later: Demand deposits are funds placed in bank accounts, like checking accounts, that account holders can access on demand. They are considered a form of agreement between the depositor and the bank, allowing the holder to withdraw funds as needed while the bank retains the obligation to repay.

    "explanation": "Collateral - Asset Used as Security for a Loan: Collateral is an asset (like real estate, vehicles, or valuable possessions) pledged by a borrower to a lender as security for a loan. If the borrower fails to repay, the lender can claim and sell the collateral to recover the loan amount.\n\nInterest Rate - Percentage Charged for Borrowing Money: Interest rate is the cost of borrowing money, usually expressed as a percentage of the loan amount. Borrowers pay this fee to lenders as compensation for the risk and opportunity cost associated with lending funds.\n\nInformal Sector Loans - Loans Obtained from Moneylenders, Friends, etc.: Informal sector loans are borrowed from sources outside of formal financial institutions, such as moneylenders, friends, or family. They often come with higher interest rates and may lack legal protections and regulatory oversight.\n\nFormal Sector Loans - Loans Obtained from Banks and Cooperatives: Formal sector loans are sourced from established financial institutions like banks and credit cooperatives.

Borrowers who lack access to formal credit may turn to moneylenders, despite the cost, due to limited alternatives.\n\nBanks - Regulated by Government: Banks are financial institutions regulated and supervised by the government or central banking authorities. These regulations ensure the stability of the financial system, protect depositors, and promote fair and ethical banking practices.\n\nCooperative Societies - Provide Cheap Credit to Rural Areas: Cooperative societies, including credit cooperatives, are member-owned organizations that aim to provide affordable credit and financial services to rural and underserved communities. They focus on cooperative principles and often offer lower interest rates compared to other lenders.\n\nInformal Sector Lenders - Accept Deposits from Members for Lending: Informal sector lenders, such as rotating savings and credit associations (ROSCAs) or chit funds, accept deposits from their members and use these funds to provide loans within the group.

It facilitates the flow of money from savers to borrowers, enabling economic growth and financial transactions.\n\nDeposit Accounts Include Savings and Fixed Deposits: Deposit accounts are financial instruments offered by banks where individuals and entities can safely store their money. Savings accounts offer easy access to funds with minimal interest, while fixed deposits lock in money for a specified period at a higher interest rate, promoting savings and financial planning.\n\nCredit Needs Require Loans for Economic Activities: Individuals and businesses often require loans to finance various economic activities, such as starting a business, buying a home, or funding education. Access to credit supports investment, consumption, and economic development by providing the necessary funds to pursue these activities.\n\nEconomic Activities Require the Use of Banking Services: In modern economies, economic activities rely on banking services. These services include payment processing, lending, investment opportunities, and financial advice. Banks play a vital role in facilitating transactions, capital formation, and financial management, contributing to overall economic stability and growth. (Reference NCERT Economy Class 10 (Ch 3))",

In a centrally planned economy, the government intervenes in all aspects of the economy, even if individuals are producing goods and services in adequate amounts.\n\nStatement IV: This statement is false. Equitable distribution of goods and services is a major goal of many centrally planned economies. The government may try to achieve this goal through policies such as price controls, rationing, and subsidies.(Reference NCERT Class 12 Microeconomics (Ch 1))",

Buyers and sellers can interact in a variety of ways, including in person, over the phone, or online. In fact, many markets today are primarily or entirely virtual.\n\nStatement IV is  true. Prices in a market are determined by the interaction of supply and demand. Supply is the amount of a good or service that sellers are willing and able to sell at a given price. Demand is the amount of a good or service that buyers are willing and able to buy at a given price.

    "answer": "all Four",
    "explanation": "All four of the statements affect the price elasticity of demand for a good.\n\nStatement I is correct. Availability of substitutes. The more easily available substitutes are for a good, the more elastic the demand for that good will be. This is because consumers can switch to substitutes if the price of their preferred good increases. For example, if the price of coffee increases, consumers may switch to tea instead.\n\nStatement II is correct. Necessity vs. luxury. Necessity goods are goods that consumers need to survive or live comfortably, such as food, water, and shelter. Luxury goods are goods that consumers do not need, but may want, such as jewelry, vacations, and expensive cars. The demand for necessity goods is generally less elastic than the demand for luxury goods. This is because consumers are less likely to give up necessity goods if their prices increase.\n\nStatement III is correct. Time horizon. The demand for a good tends to be more elastic in the long run than in the short run. This is because consumers have more time to adjust their consumption habits in the long run. For example, if the price of gasoline increases, consumers may switch to a more fuel-efficient car in the long run, but they may not be able to do so immediately in the short run.\n\nStatement IV is correct. Total expenditure on the good. The demand for a good is more elastic if it represents a large proportion of consumers' total expenditure. This is because consumers are more likely to cut back on their consumption of a good if its price increases significantly. (Reference NCERT  Class 12 Microeconomics (Ch 2))",

    "explanation": "The amount of a good that a consumer chooses optimally depends on a number of factors, including:\n\nStatement I is correct. The price of the good itself: The higher the price of a good, the less of it a consumer is likely to consume. This is because consumers have limited budgets and must make trade-offs between different goods.\n\nStatement II is correct. The prices of other goods: The prices of other goods can also influence a consumer's demand for a particular good. For example, if the price of a substitute good decreases, consumers may switch to that good instead, which would reduce their demand for the original good.\n\nStatement III is correct. The consumer's income: The consumer's income is another important factor that influences demand. As income increases, consumers can afford to buy more goods, including the good in question.\n\nStatement IV is correct. The consumer's tastes and preferences: The consumer's tastes and preferences also play a role in determining demand.

The elasticity of the market supply curve depends on a number of factors, including the elasticity of the individual firms' supply curves and the degree of competition in the market. An increase in the number of firms could make the market supply curve more elastic, but it could also make it less elastic.\n\nStatement III is not necessarily correct. The equilibrium price in a market is determined by the intersection of the supply and demand curves.

The equilibrium quantity in a market is the quantity at which the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded.

This is because the quantity supplied at any given price will be greater, and the equilibrium price will be lower.(Reference NCERT Class 12 Microeconomics (Ch 4))",

    "question": "Consider the following statements\n\nStatement I: A perfectly competitive market is characterized by free entry and exit of firms.\n\nStatement II: In a perfectly competitive market, firms are price-makers.\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct",
    "answer": "I only",
    "explanation": "Statement I is true. One of the key characteristics of a perfectly competitive market is that firms can enter or exit the market without any barriers. This is important because it ensures that there is always competition in the market, which helps to keep prices low and quality high.\n\nStatement II is false. In a perfectly competitive market, firms are price-takers. This means that they cannot influence the market price of their products. Instead, they must accept the market price as determined by the supply and demand curves.(Reference NCERT Class 12 Microeconomics (Ch 4))",

    "question": "Consider the following pairs:\n\n1. Opportunity cost : sum of all the costs incurred in producing a good or service.\n\n2. Firm’s profit : difference between a firm’s total revenue and its total cost.\n\n3. Total cost of production : value of the next best alternative given up when a choice a made.\n\nWhich of the above pair/pairs is /are correctly matched?",
    "answer": "2 only",
    "explanation": "pair 1 is incorrect. Opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative that is given up when a choice is made. For example, if a student chooses to study for a test instead of going to the movies, the opportunity cost of studying is the enjoyment they would have gotten from going to the movies.\n\npair 2 is correct. Firm’s profit is the difference between a firm’s total revenue and its total cost. Total revenue is the total amount of money that a firm earns from selling its products or services. Total cost is the sum of all the costs incurred in producing a good or service.\n\npair 3 is incorrect. Total cost of production is the sum of all the costs incurred in producing a good or service. These costs can be divided into two categories: fixed costs and variable costs. Fixed costs are costs that do not change with the level of output, such as rent and depreciation. Variable costs are costs that change with the level of output, such as labor and materials.(Reference NCERT Class 12 Microeconomics (Ch 4))",

    "answer": "market price equals marginal cost.",
    "explanation": "A profit-maximizing firm will produce at the output level where market price equals marginal cost. This is because at this output level, the firm is making the maximum possible profit.\n\nIf the firm produces more than this output level, marginal cost will exceed market price, and the firm will start to lose money on each additional unit it produces. If the firm produces less than this output level, marginal revenue will exceed marginal cost, and the firm could increase its profits by producing additional units.(Reference NCERT Class 12 Microeconomics (Ch 4))",

    "question": "Consider the following statements about factors that can cause the supply curve to shift to the left:\n\nI. An decrease in the price of inputs\n\nII. A decrease in the number of sellers\n\nIII. A natural disaster that damages production facilities\n\nIV. A new government regulation that increases the cost of production\n\nHow many of the statement/s given above is/are correct?",
    "answer": "Only three",
    "explanation": "Statement I is incorrect: A decrease in the price of inputs will make it cheaper for producers to produce goods and services, which will shift the supply curve to the right. Therefore, an increase in the price of inputs will shift the supply curve to the left.\n\nStatement II is correct: A decrease in the number of sellers will mean that there is less supply of the good or service, which will shift the supply curve to the left.\n\nStatement III is correct: A natural disaster that damages production facilities will reduce the ability of producers to produce goods and services, which will shift the supply curve to the left.\n\nStatement IV is correct: A new government regulation that increases the cost of production will make it more expensive for producers to produce goods and services, which will shift the supply curve to the left.(Reference NCERT Class 12 Microeconomics (Ch 4))",
